  "ABOUT_LUCA_BERGMAN_DESCRIPTION": "I developed this website out of sheer annoyance for the cube of the HBO-I domain description. Many students, including myself, found it difficult to use because it was slow and cluttered. Teachers also experienced it this way because it was not possible to communicate extra information to the student.\n\nAs a result, it was often unclear that for example, you only had to meet the criteria of one of the paragraphs to achieve a certain level of HBO-I. It was also very difficult to quickly find the right HBO-I between all 100 different levels or to share the definition of a HBO-I with a fellow student.\n\nPartly thanks to LEF, it is now possible to filter through the HBO-I's and Open-ICT skills with a quick and simple filter system, including a nice shareable link!\n",
